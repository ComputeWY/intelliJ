# WY github
 
 # Who am I ?

I am a university student studying to become a 27-year-old developer. I entered university late after pursuing other things (actually failed music, but...) and majored in physics. I have been studying programming on my own every day for the past year.

# For Programming
I've been studying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for about a year now, but I still have a lot to learn. In the beginning, I focused mainly on vanilla JavaScript, so I'm still lacking in areas like writing code. However, I'm learning web development with JavaScript through clone coding about once a week. Additionally, I've been studying Java for about six months and learning algorithms and data structures through Java. In terms of other CS subjects, I'm currently taking classes on operating systems and networks, and I learned Java through university courses last year.

# What do I really want?
Ultimately, through studying programming, my goal is to make money, which isn't a particularly grand ambition, but I can say that I'm studying for it while pursuing my current interest in music.
